<h3>PTPlot</h3>
<p>PTPlot is a tool for exploring the gravitational wave power
  spectrum from first-order phase transitions, and evaluating the
  likelihood of detecting a signal with the LISA mission.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="single">Plot single point</a> and view the SNR and
  power spectra</li>
  <li><a href="multiple">Plot multiple points</a> given tabular data</li>
  <li><a href="models">Browse and plot benchmark points</a> for selected models</li>
</ul>
<h4>About the output</h4>
<p>All output figures
  are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">Scalable
  Vector Graphics</a> (SVG) and can be downloaded and edited with free
  tools such as <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>. They are
  also easily converted to PDF or bitmapped formats by Inkscape or
  built-in OS tools.</p>
<h4>Crediting PTPlot</h4>
<p>The results plotted by this tool are based on the forthcoming LISA
  Cosmology Working Group update paper. You are welcome to include
  plots from PTPlot in your own work; if you do use PTPlot, please
  cite that paper. Figures without the LISACosWG watermark are
  available on request; please do not remove it without
  permission.</p>
<h4>Source</h4>
<p>The source for PTPlot is available
  at <a href="https://bitbucket.org/dweir/ptplot">https://bitbucket.org/dweir/ptplot</a>. Please
  do not, however, use this code in your own projects without
  permission.</p>
<h4>Recent news</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>21.12.2018</b> - version 0.9.1
    <ul>
      <li>The SNR curves and power spectra now use a single
	merged <span style="font-family: monospace">PowerSpectrum()</span> class.</li>
      <li>All plots use a conservative form of the sound wave source
      where it has lifetime set either by the shock formation time or
      the Hubble time, whichever is shorter.</li>
      <li>All plots have a
	date and timestep to assist with debugging.</li>
      <li>Power spectrum plots
	have the SNR (from sound waves only) overplotted, too.</li>
    </ul>
