<h2>PTPlot: About</h2>
<p>PTPlot is a tool for exploring the gravitational wave power
  spectrum from first-order phase transitions, and evaluating the
  likelihood of detecting a signal with the LISA mission.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="single">Plot single point</a> and view the SNR and
  power spectra</li>
  <li><a href="multiple">Plot multiple points</a> given tabular data</li>
  <li><a href="models">Browse and plot benchmark points</a> for selected models</li>
</ul>
<h3>About the output</h3>
<ul>
  <li>All <em>output figures</em>
    are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">Scalable
    Vector Graphics</a> (SVG) and can be downloaded and edited with
    free tools such
    as <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>. They are also
    easily converted to PDF or bitmapped formats by Inkscape or
    built-in OS tools, e.g.:
<pre>$ <b>inkscape input_snr_file.svg
    --export-pdf=outpout_snr_file.pdf</b></pre> Note that on Macos,
    Inkscape requires the <em>full path</em> to the source and
destination files in order to work.
  </li>
  <li>The <em>CSV files</em> that can be downloaded on 'single point'
    plotting pages contain the following columns (these are labeled on
    the first row):
    $$
    f,\, h^2 \Omega_\text{sensitivity}, \, h^2 \Omega_\text{GW, sw},\,
    [h^2 \Omega_\text{GW, turb}, \, h^2 \Omega_\text{GW, tot} ].
    $$
    There is therefore no explicit dependence on the Hubble rate in
    the data.
  </li>
</ul>

  papers <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05871">arXiv:1704.05871</a>, <em>Shape
  of the acoustic gravitational wave power spectrum from a first order

      <li>Corrected value of sound wave power spectrum prefactor (per erratum of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05871">arXiv:1704.05871</a>).
      <li>Changes to appearance for readability.</li>
      <li>URLs which return SVG or CSV files now have the extension in the URL to make it a more pleasant experience when saving the file.</li>
      <li>Use <pre>scipy.integrate.trapz</pre> rather than some weird in-house code for calculating the integrated SNR.</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>5.3.2020</b> - version 1.0.1
    <ul>
      <li>Can be installed with pip3 (for standalone use):
	<pre>pip3 install --upgrade
	  --git+https://dweir@bitbucket.org/dweir/ptplot.git</pre></li>
      <li>Fixes a systematic error due to having logarithmically
      spaced data for the sensitivity curve, while eLISATools.py
      cannot cope with anything but evenly spaced points. Wrote a new
      replacement for the relevant commands that does numerical
	integration with an arbitrary interval.</li>
      <li>Fixed the value of $\tilde{\Omega}_\text{gw}$ from 0.12 to
      0.012. This was due to a typo
      in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05871">arXiv:1704.05871</a>
      below Equation 45, which will be corrected in a forthcoming
	erratum.</li>
      <li>Power spectra and sensitivity data can now be downloaded as
	a CSV from individual point pages.</li>
      <li>Minor fixes due to changes in Django.</li>
      <li>Some improvements to the benchmark point database.</li>

      <li>Minor tick marks now shown.</li>
      <li>In plotting power spectra, only the sound wave curve is now

      <li>Bugfixes, including: corrections to definition of $\kappa$
      and a missing factor of $h^2$ in the sound wave GW power
      spectrum.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>25.6.2019</b> - version 0.9.5
    <ul>

      <li>Bugfixes to the "energy budget" calculation, which
      previously had some discrepancies at intermediate
	velocities.</li>
      <li>Axis labels cleaned up.</li>
      <li>"Theories" renamed to "Models" and another layer of
	granularity, "Scenarios", added to benchmark points.</li>
      <li>More flexibility in terms of individual points and scenarios
	having their own $T_*$ and $v_\mathrm{w}$.</li>
      <li>$\beta/H$ is now plotted (and used as a parameter) rather
	than $H/\beta$.</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>21.12.2018</b> - version 0.9.2

	merged <span style="font-family: monospace">PowerSpectrum()</span> class.</li>
      <li>All plots use a conservative form of the sound wave source
      where it has lifetime set either by the shock formation time or
      the Hubble time, whichever is shorter.</li>
      <li>All plots have a
	date and timestep to assist with debugging.</li>
      <li>Power spectrum plots
	have the SNR (from sound waves only) overplotted, too.</li>
